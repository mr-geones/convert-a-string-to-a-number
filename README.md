We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.

Examples: <br>

"1234" --> 1234 <br> 
"605"  --> 605 <br> 
"1405" --> 1405 <br> 
"-7" --> -7
